If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth?

Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is.

Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. I made a huge tiny mistake. I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it?

He's going to be all right. There are dozens of us! Dozens! Let the great experiment begin! The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON.

This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'.

If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. Those are balls. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?

It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook.

No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Tobias is Queen Mary. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it. You'd do that to your own brother? I said "cot." That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist.

No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! It feels good to be back in a queen! Let me out that Queen. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep].

Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel?

Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? Fried cheese… with club sauce. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can.

After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. I'm gonna go get sexy. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where?

Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. But where did the lighter fluid come from? And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob.

Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. Tobias Fünke costume. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. I should be in this Poof. I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect.

In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious.

Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC?

Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. GENE!! [screams] Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne.

Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. Douche chill! GENE!! [screams] I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table.

It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong?

Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits.

A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror.

It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. Got a big ass room at the travelodge. What a fun, sexy time for you. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. GENE!! [screams] You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish.

Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough.

It walked on my pillow! I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Bob Loblaw Law Blog. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza.

Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Speaking of settling, how's Ann? If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care!

Chickens don't clap! Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? He's going to be all right.

Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. Hair up, glasses off. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office.

Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. Butterscotch! Want a lick? My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. You boys know how to shovel coal? Let's see some bananas and nuts! Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle.
